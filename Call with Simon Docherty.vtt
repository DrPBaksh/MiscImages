00:00:03.094 --> 00:00:08.485
<v Peter Baksh>There I was thinking about is when you
know you've got learners signed up to a</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/6-1
00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:13.125
<v Peter Baksh>course and then you're sending out the
e-mail for the launch event.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/5-0
00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:10.774
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/6-2
00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.332
<v Peter Baksh>But then am I right in thinking if they
can't,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/6-3
00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:21.654
<v Peter Baksh>you give them an option of launch events
or potentially they can't make them?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/7-0
00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Simon Docherty>We, we, we,
we we try to to some launches we will run</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/7-1
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Simon Docherty>revised events for leadership management
we do the launch in there and and data so</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/7-2
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Simon Docherty>DPDA and DDL we run revised sessions for
mainly because we have a lot of volume of</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/7-3
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.814
<v Simon Docherty>those.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/9-0
00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:46.307
<v Simon Docherty>And not so much on the others.
So where we have those we've planned in</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/9-1
00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:52.067
<v Simon Docherty>or we plan in a list of dates and we've
created forms on monday.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/9-2
00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:56.233
<v Simon Docherty>com whereby we paste the link into the
invite.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/9-3
00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.334
<v Simon Docherty>So the invite goes hi Peter please.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/11-0
00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:03.643
<v Simon Docherty>As you really join in the course,
it should start on this day.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/11-1
00:01:03.643 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Simon Docherty>It should be on this time. However,
if you can't attend,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/11-2
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.571
<v Simon Docherty>please click on one only of the links
below and we'll arrange for a revised</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/11-3
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.331
<v Simon Docherty>launch for you,
and so they the idea is to click one of</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/10-0
00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:14.054
<v Peter Baksh>OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/11-4
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:18.814
<v Simon Docherty>those. We're getting people clicking.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/12-0
00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:22.773
<v Simon Docherty>Both we're getting people still sending
those emails,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/12-1
00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:28.601
<v Simon Docherty>but that's kind of a user issue that we
need to sort of figure out how we tighten</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/12-2
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.729
<v Simon Docherty>up on.
But that then drops in to our Monday</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/12-3
00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.856
<v Simon Docherty>board.
We then will pick that up on a daily</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/12-4
00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:38.694
<v Simon Docherty>basis every other day sort of at the
latest and then.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/13-0
00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:42.942
<v Simon Docherty>So we'll add them to the invite for the
revised launch session,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/13-1
00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:46.886
<v Simon Docherty>because that's the one they've told us
they want to attend,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/13-2
00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:52.342
<v Simon Docherty>and then we send a tracker off to apptem,
to ECC so that they can update the start</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/13-3
00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:55.694
<v Simon Docherty>date on Apptem to match the date that we
run with.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/14-0
00:01:56.814 --> 00:01:57.214
<v Peter Baksh>OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/15-0
00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:01.745
<v Simon Docherty>Now that is a big part of the programme
in terms of not the programme,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/15-1
00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Simon Docherty>a big part of our role in terms of we're
busy,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/15-2
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.003
<v Simon Docherty>we send out quite a lot of invites to
obviously a lot of people and then it's</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/15-3
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:15.486
<v Simon Docherty>picking through those when people return
saying I can't attend it and that was the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/15-4
00:02:15.486 --> 00:02:16.014
<v Simon Docherty>fastest.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/17-0
00:02:16.174 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Simon Docherty>That we we came up with previously,
it was just an e-mail came in.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/17-1
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.471
<v Simon Docherty>It was either a declined e-mail and we
would follow up or they would write back</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/16-0
00:02:23.174 --> 00:02:23.494
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/17-2
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:26.995
<v Simon Docherty>to us saying I can't do this.
I'm away on leave or I'm in a meeting or</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/17-3
00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:30.072
<v Simon Docherty>whatever the reason is.
And then we would send back a revise.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/17-4
00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:32.454
<v Simon Docherty>So we've managed to cut back on a lot of
those.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/19-0
00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:35.828
<v Simon Docherty>Emails,
but it would be nice to get some kind of</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/19-1
00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:40.805
<v Simon Docherty>an automation or something where we can
plug those data in because obviously it's</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/19-2
00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:45.356
<v Simon Docherty>a fixed point in time, isn't it?
It's once we've once we've committed to a</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/18-0
00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:44.774
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/19-3
00:02:45.356 --> 00:02:48.148
<v Simon Docherty>revised launch date,
then that's in the book.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/19-4
00:02:48.148 --> 00:02:51.001
<v Simon Docherty>Everybody knows it,
BD knows the ECC knows it,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/19-5
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:52.214
<v Simon Docherty>so we can't move it.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/20-0
00:02:52.294 --> 00:02:56.964
<v Simon Docherty>That easily. So that's where maybe yeah,
I can be able to pick that out and we're</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/20-1
00:02:56.964 --> 00:03:00.381
<v Simon Docherty>going, oh, you're on this programme.
We've got these dates,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/20-2
00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Simon Docherty>but there are some rules that we look at
because you don't want somebody starting</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/20-3
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.783
<v Simon Docherty>too late.
So ideally you want them within month</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/20-4
00:03:07.783 --> 00:03:11.884
<v Simon Docherty>first of all and we've started,
we've started to offer out launch dates</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/20-5
00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:12.054
<v Simon Docherty>or.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/21-0
00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:17.493
<v Simon Docherty>Advised launch dates that are earlier
than the cohort launch date, but again,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/21-1
00:03:17.493 --> 00:03:22.538
<v Simon Docherty>we've got to be a little bit careful
about who is going to be the PDE and</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/21-2
00:03:22.538 --> 00:03:27.311
<v Simon Docherty>who's on that facility of the coach
rather now, isn't it their coach?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/21-3
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.174
<v Simon Docherty>So that if it's a new person occasionally.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/23-0
00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:36.638
<v Simon Docherty>We've been having where a coach doesn't
join the company until after the cohort</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/23-1
00:03:36.638 --> 00:03:41.246
<v Simon Docherty>launch, which isn't ideal,
but obviously if we're arranging an early</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/22-0
00:03:39.254 --> 00:03:39.494
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/23-2
00:03:41.246 --> 00:03:45.454
<v Simon Docherty>launch then that puts on a little bit
more pressure for Sally.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/24-0
00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:50.153
<v Simon Docherty>Carter and her team to make sure with the
learn every scene within those first</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/24-1
00:03:50.153 --> 00:03:52.469
<v Simon Docherty>three weeks,
because obviously that's that's your</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/24-2
00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.534
<v Simon Docherty>major compliance issue.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/25-0
00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.134
<v Peter Baksh>OK. Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/26-0
00:03:56.094 --> 00:03:57.334
<v Simon Docherty>Quite a lot moving parts.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/28-0
00:03:59.014 --> 00:03:59.134
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/27-0
00:03:59.094 --> 00:03:59.214
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/31-0
00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:06.829
<v Peter Baksh>Yes, I can. That's yeah,
that's similar to what I was thinking.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/31-1
00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:14.079
<v Peter Baksh>You have monday.com in there.
Is that purely just to collate a list of</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/29-0
00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:13.494
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/31-2
00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.814
<v Peter Baksh>people who can't?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/30-0
00:04:16.414 --> 00:04:16.534
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/32-0
00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:19.014
<v Peter Baksh>Pretend is there any other function used?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/33-0
00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:23.894
<v Simon Docherty>No, we do a lot. We do a lot with Monday.
So our if I share the screen,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/33-1
00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:27.734
<v Simon Docherty>our resourcing is primarily done on
monday.com.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/34-0
00:04:29.534 --> 00:04:33.654
<v Simon Docherty>So I think the long term is we'll
probably end up losing this.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/36-0
00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:37.844
<v Simon Docherty>Programme.
There's a few of the higher management</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/36-1
00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:41.796
<v Simon Docherty>aren't really keen on it.
It's quite expensive to use and when you</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/36-2
00:04:41.796 --> 00:04:44.746
<v Simon Docherty>work through we've got lots of different
systems.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/36-3
00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:49.524
<v Simon Docherty>So trying to connect everything now BD
work on HubSpot for their bits we work on</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/35-0
00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:48.454
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/36-4
00:04:49.524 --> 00:04:52.474
<v Simon Docherty>monday.
com for our resourcing and our other bits</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/36-5
00:04:52.474 --> 00:04:54.774
<v Simon Docherty>and then obviously the learner details.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/37-0
00:04:54.854 --> 00:05:02.402
<v Simon Docherty>And everything are in Uptown.
So what we have so how the system will</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/37-1
00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:10.934
<v Simon Docherty>work is currently and this is more about
managing changes is I go to HubSpot.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/40-0
00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:16.191
<v Simon Docherty>And I can see all the up and coming deals
up until February.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/40-1
00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:21.755
<v Simon Docherty>And I and I do that on a daily basis.
So to automate that would be quite nice.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/38-0
00:05:16.334 --> 00:05:16.654
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/39-0
00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:19.974
<v Peter Baksh>OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/40-2
00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.854
<v Simon Docherty>I do that on a daily basis.
Then what I do.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/41-0
00:05:24.054 --> 00:05:29.574
<v Peter Baksh>Wait, wait. See. See.
Look in and you look at all the new. Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/43-0
00:05:27.654 --> 00:05:31.232
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah,
so so there's an advanced philtre there.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/43-1
00:05:31.232 --> 00:05:36.941
<v Simon Docherty>So the close date is the launch date is
between today and then the 28th of</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/43-2
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:43.334
<v Simon Docherty>February. So I look six months in advance.
The reason for that is and I'll load up.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/42-0
00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:39.534
<v Peter Baksh>OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/44-0
00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:45.254
<v Simon Docherty>The spreadsheet that I've got.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/45-0
00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.727
<v Simon Docherty>And the reason why it's a manual,
because we could,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/45-1
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:56.296
<v Simon Docherty>we could do this automatically,
which would be lovely. However,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/45-2
00:05:56.296 --> 00:05:59.294
<v Simon Docherty>we want to be able to monitor the changes.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/48-0
00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:05.727
<v Simon Docherty>So let me turn that back on there.
So what happens is I've got a yesterday</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/48-1
00:06:05.727 --> 00:06:10.377
<v Simon Docherty>report, so that was pulled on Friday.
I've got a today report that's been</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/48-2
00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:15.592
<v Simon Docherty>pulled today and then through power query
it then pulls out the 2 reports and then</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/46-0
00:06:10.694 --> 00:06:10.894
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/48-3
00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:17.854
<v Simon Docherty>through some conditional formatting.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/47-0
00:06:16.414 --> 00:06:16.534
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/50-0
00:06:18.614 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Simon Docherty>I can see on here where changes have
occurred. So for example,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/49-0
00:06:22.654 --> 00:06:22.934
<v Peter Baksh>Yep.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/50-1
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Simon Docherty>there was no deal there yesterday and
sorry, there is no deal there today.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/50-2
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.374
<v Simon Docherty>But there was a deal there yesterday.
So that's either being lost.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/51-0
00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:39.216
<v Simon Docherty>Or it's gone as in the dates past.
So these two dates there have happened</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/51-1
00:06:39.216 --> 00:06:43.284
<v Simon Docherty>their launches.
It's occurred this one is in the future,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/51-2
00:06:43.284 --> 00:06:48.494
<v Simon Docherty>but that deal has now been lost.
And that deal has now been lost purple.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/52-0
00:06:49.174 --> 00:06:52.655
<v Simon Docherty>Their new deals are just showing up on
today's report,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/52-1
00:06:52.655 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Simon Docherty>so they weren't there yesterday,
so their new deals at BD are fed into the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/52-2
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.501
<v Simon Docherty>system. OK,
so I can I I can sort of I can do an</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/52-3
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:04.045
<v Simon Docherty>upload of those into Monday and that's
quite quick now,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/52-4
00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:08.094
<v Simon Docherty>but it's things where if I take this out.
So if I put in there.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/53-0
00:07:10.814 --> 00:07:14.974
<v Simon Docherty>Take out the blanks and take out the
blanks of here.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/55-0
00:07:18.574 --> 00:07:24.555
<v Simon Docherty>Then what I'm left with is deals that
were on today's report and yesterday's</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/54-0
00:07:24.414 --> 00:07:24.654
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/55-1
00:07:24.555 --> 00:07:28.283
<v Simon Docherty>report,
and then if I philtre by colour for the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/55-2
00:07:28.283 --> 00:07:32.400
<v Simon Docherty>close date,
these launches have changed their launch</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/55-3
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.574
<v Simon Docherty>date so that one was due to.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/57-0
00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:39.909
<v Simon Docherty>Be running on the 30th of October has now
moved out to the 3rd of December.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/56-0
00:07:37.214 --> 00:07:37.614
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/57-1
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:43.767
<v Simon Docherty>That one was the 12th of November.
Moved out to the 26th,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/57-2
00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:47.957
<v Simon Docherty>12th and 20th of November.
Moved out to the third of the 12th.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/57-3
00:07:47.957 --> 00:07:51.814
<v Simon Docherty>So it's these little changes that we need
to be tracking.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/58-0
00:07:52.174 --> 00:07:56.254
<v Simon Docherty>To then provide an update,
so I will make the change on uh.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/59-0
00:07:57.694 --> 00:07:58.654
<v Simon Docherty>Monday.com.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/60-0
00:07:59.614 --> 00:07:59.934
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/61-0
00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:05.053
<v Simon Docherty>And if I clear this out and go to the
main table in here,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/61-1
00:08:05.053 --> 00:08:10.764
<v Simon Docherty>we have all of the deals that we've we've
worked on this year, right? Everything.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/61-2
00:08:10.764 --> 00:08:14.454
<v Simon Docherty>So from the start of January,
right the way through?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/62-0
00:08:16.374 --> 00:08:22.350
<v Simon Docherty>And we've got them split into open deals,
which is lots of smaller deals that then</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/62-1
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:28.182
<v Simon Docherty>come together to form the larger cohort.
So what I would do is I would copy that</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/62-2
00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:28.974
<v Simon Docherty>into there.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/63-0
00:08:33.014 --> 00:08:36.276
<v Simon Docherty>I would make the change in date which is
now the third,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/63-1
00:08:36.276 --> 00:08:40.643
<v Simon Docherty>but then I also send a message to
everybody that's working on the board so</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/63-2
00:08:40.643 --> 00:08:45.302
<v Simon Docherty>that they can see the changes happened
and that's the big one because we've got</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/63-3
00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:49.961
<v Simon Docherty>so many deals because I mean we could we
could feed this in on a daily basis no</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/63-4
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:52.174
<v Simon Docherty>problem and you could have it updated.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/64-0
00:08:52.254 --> 00:08:55.993
<v Simon Docherty>And on a daily basis, no problem.
But it's getting that message so that</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/64-1
00:08:55.993 --> 00:08:59.888
<v Simon Docherty>where someone's working on a deal,
they know that there's an issue with it</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/64-2
00:08:59.888 --> 00:09:03.731
<v Simon Docherty>or the numbers have increased or whatever,
because if a number increases,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/64-3
00:09:03.731 --> 00:09:07.054
<v Simon Docherty>that could mean you're getting a new PDE
or a new coach. Sorry.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/65-0
00:09:08.494 --> 00:09:13.698
<v Simon Docherty>Or it could be we swapping coaches around,
so there's lots of technicalities as to</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/65-1
00:09:13.698 --> 00:09:17.334
<v Simon Docherty>why that's that needs to be done on a
manual check basis.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/66-0
00:09:18.894 --> 00:09:20.574
<v Simon Docherty>Does does that all make sense so far?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/67-0
00:09:20.614 --> 00:09:22.254
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah, yeah, it it. It does.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/69-0
00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:27.285
<v Simon Docherty>And then we've got a few more boards that
are connected.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/69-1
00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:31.001
<v Simon Docherty>So where we start and add resource.
So this is your coach.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/69-2
00:09:31.001 --> 00:09:34.970
<v Simon Docherty>This is a new coach.
There's a process here whereby we send an</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/69-3
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.694
<v Simon Docherty>e-mail. So are you still coaching?
Are you permanently on your other role?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/68-0
00:09:39.374 --> 00:09:39.494
<v Peter Baksh>None.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/70-0
00:09:41.454 --> 00:09:45.654
<v Peter Baksh>I'm not currently coaching,
but technically my contract is as a coach.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/71-0
00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:48.593
<v Simon Docherty>It's still, yeah. So,
so the reason I was asking is you'll know</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/71-1
00:09:48.593 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Simon Docherty>the back end of this point where we then
send out an e-mail or resources sends out</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/71-2
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.339
<v Simon Docherty>an e-mail to you to say hi, Peter,
this is what we're giving you as the next</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/71-3
00:09:57.339 --> 00:10:00.454
<v Simon Docherty>cohort, you're happy with it,
is there any issues you'd?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/72-0
00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:06.208
<v Simon Docherty>Confirm it with your DD. Say you're happy,
let us know and then everything can roll</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/72-1
00:10:06.208 --> 00:10:09.308
<v Simon Docherty>forward.
So we use it for the resourcing on that</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/72-2
00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:12.154
<v Simon Docherty>side.
We also use it as a planning board and</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/72-3
00:10:12.154 --> 00:10:17.215
<v Simon Docherty>there's a separate view on here for my
team where we see where the progress is,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/72-4
00:10:17.215 --> 00:10:20.694
<v Simon Docherty>what's needing set up in the background
so the slides.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/73-0
00:10:20.934 --> 00:10:25.086
<v Simon Docherty>The workshops all of those bits,
but we carry details on here like the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/73-1
00:10:25.086 --> 00:10:29.237
<v Simon Docherty>bespoke programme name start and end
times, who's going to facilitate?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/73-2
00:10:29.237 --> 00:10:32.804
<v Simon Docherty>Do we have any specific learner
adjustments we need to make?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/73-3
00:10:32.804 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Simon Docherty>Is there a guest speaker?
So there's a lot on there or the location</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/73-4
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.534
<v Simon Docherty>if it's a face to face launch.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/75-0
00:10:38.974 --> 00:10:45.048
<v Simon Docherty>So we don't just use one set of, you know,
we're not just using Monday just to pull</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/75-1
00:10:45.048 --> 00:10:48.301
<v Simon Docherty>bits through.
So that's the resource inside.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/75-2
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:54.013
<v Simon Docherty>And then separately and the customer
success team use this board as well as my</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/75-3
00:10:54.013 --> 00:10:54.374
<v Simon Docherty>team.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/76-0
00:10:54.934 --> 00:11:00.577
<v Simon Docherty>And this is the onboarding part we have
learners in onboarding and here should be</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/76-1
00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:03.879
<v Simon Docherty>listed all of the learners.
If I go into there,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/76-2
00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:09.453
<v Simon Docherty>all of the learners who were coming onto
programme and have been enrolled within</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/76-3
00:11:09.453 --> 00:11:11.654
<v Simon Docherty>the last, I think it's 120 days.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/77-0
00:11:12.774 --> 00:11:17.178
<v Simon Docherty>And they're all grouped.
So for example August launch there is we</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/77-1
00:11:17.178 --> 00:11:21.916
<v Simon Docherty>can see 33 learners on there.
We can see the states of them and we can</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/77-2
00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:24.985
<v Simon Docherty>see where they are within the launch
process.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/77-3
00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.454
<v Simon Docherty>So there's quite a few bits in there.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/78-0
00:11:28.694 --> 00:11:34.397
<v Simon Docherty>Separate to that is the well,
I say separate is the invites,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/78-1
00:11:34.397 --> 00:11:42.063
<v Simon Docherty>So what we will do as a team is we will
get noticed that the CLM has been created</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/78-2
00:11:42.063 --> 00:11:44.774
<v Simon Docherty>and then if I'm find on here.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/79-0
00:11:47.334 --> 00:11:53.018
<v Simon Docherty>Launch status is to be invited,
then this is a great example.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/79-1
00:11:53.018 --> 00:11:59.069
<v Simon Docherty>So we've got the CLM for this.
So these are all the learners that</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/79-2
00:11:59.069 --> 00:12:02.094
<v Simon Docherty>originally are planned to attend.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/81-0
00:12:02.814 --> 00:12:07.327
<v Simon Docherty>The launch they're going to join the
programme and then what we need to do is</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/80-0
00:12:05.654 --> 00:12:05.934
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/81-1
00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:09.989
<v Simon Docherty>we need to turn all of these into the
invite.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/81-2
00:12:09.989 --> 00:12:14.444
<v Simon Docherty>So all of these names need to go on the
invite and we can do that through an</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/81-3
00:12:14.444 --> 00:12:19.014
<v Simon Docherty>export, which is relatively simple.
So all of those names go on to the invite.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/82-0
00:12:20.294 --> 00:12:21.654
<v Simon Docherty>The invite is then sent.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/83-0
00:12:23.614 --> 00:12:23.854
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/85-0
00:12:24.254 --> 00:12:27.595
<v Simon Docherty>And then that's where you start and get
that feedback,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/85-1
00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:32.394
<v Simon Docherty>where learners will then start to say I
can't make that date or I can't do the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/84-0
00:12:31.814 --> 00:12:31.934
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/85-2
00:12:32.394 --> 00:12:35.188
<v Simon Docherty>morning or whatever reason they can't
attend.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/85-3
00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:37.374
<v Simon Docherty>And that is where we then if I open.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/86-0
00:12:39.654 --> 00:12:40.694
<v Simon Docherty>Let's go to today.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/87-0
00:12:42.814 --> 00:12:43.654
<v Simon Docherty>I open.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/88-0
00:12:47.454 --> 00:12:52.451
<v Simon Docherty>This one up so this in this invite isn't
actually related to that cohort there,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/88-1
00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:57.134
<v Simon Docherty>but we've got the details and then
underneath this is what we've inserted.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/90-0
00:12:58.774 --> 00:13:01.601
<v Simon Docherty>So full launch attendance is required to
start your programme.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/90-1
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:03.710
<v Simon Docherty>If you cannot attend alternate data
available,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/89-0
00:13:01.894 --> 00:13:02.174
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/90-2
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.166
<v Simon Docherty>please select only one revised launch
date and that's where they would click</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/90-3
00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:07.614
<v Simon Docherty>this link.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/91-0
00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.734
<v Simon Docherty>And then it would take them to the.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/92-0
00:13:12.974 --> 00:13:13.694
<v Simon Docherty>You gonna let me do it?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/93-0
00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:17.694
<v Simon Docherty>We then get taken to this form.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/95-0
00:13:19.894 --> 00:13:23.329
<v Simon Docherty>That one's closed because the launch is
for tomorrow,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/94-0
00:13:23.054 --> 00:13:23.414
<v Peter Baksh>OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/95-1
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:26.254
<v Simon Docherty>and then what we're doing is we capture
that.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/96-0
00:13:28.094 --> 00:13:28.934
<v Simon Docherty>And here.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/97-0
00:13:31.054 --> 00:13:32.334
<v Simon Docherty>Wanna be down here actually?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/98-0
00:13:39.614 --> 00:13:43.614
<v Simon Docherty>So we capture these details and we're
going to load up.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/99-0
00:13:51.214 --> 00:13:55.292
<v Simon Docherty>That's better.
And then we've done some linking whereby</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/99-1
00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:59.588
<v Simon Docherty>the learner is telling us which launch
they want to go on.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/99-2
00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:05.705
<v Simon Docherty>We then link it to that customer learners
in onboarding page and then we update the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/99-3
00:14:05.705 --> 00:14:06.214
<v Simon Docherty>status.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/100-0
00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:12.411
<v Simon Docherty>On here and then that link will take us
to ECC where we know if I ECC that the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/100-1
00:14:12.411 --> 00:14:15.134
<v Simon Docherty>learner is going to attend on the 25th.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/101-0
00:14:18.334 --> 00:14:23.255
<v Simon Docherty>And then they're they're physically added
to the next invite for the 25th,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/101-1
00:14:23.255 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Simon Docherty>and then they either accept or decline
that one.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/101-2
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.981
<v Simon Docherty>And that's kind of the cycle that we work
through on there. But it is, like I said,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/101-3
00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:32.374
<v Simon Docherty>quite.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/102-0
00:14:32.974 --> 00:14:35.453
<v Simon Docherty>Well,
you've seen there how sort of manual it</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/102-1
00:14:35.453 --> 00:14:35.614
<v Simon Docherty>is.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/104-0
00:14:38.134 --> 00:14:38.454
<v Peter Baksh>Thank you.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/103-0
00:14:39.014 --> 00:14:39.134
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/106-0
00:14:40.854 --> 00:14:45.879
<v Peter Baksh>Something I'm taking away from this is it.
It is a little bit of a messy process</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/105-0
00:14:45.614 --> 00:14:45.734
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/106-1
00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:48.174
<v Peter Baksh>that does not involve your oversight.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/107-0
00:14:47.574 --> 00:14:49.454
<v Simon Docherty>Yes, yes.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/108-0
00:14:50.534 --> 00:14:51.654
<v Peter Baksh>Now that.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/109-0
00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:56.641
<v Peter Baksh>Therefore makes it quite challenging,
potentially,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/109-1
00:14:56.641 --> 00:15:01.374
<v Peter Baksh>for just the standard automation,
because it is not a simple thing, but.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/110-0
00:15:04.414 --> 00:15:06.814
<v Peter Baksh>What I'm I know you said you weren't.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/111-0
00:15:08.214 --> 00:15:15.894
<v Peter Baksh>So it's particularly confident in AI
tools. Now what we can.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/114-0
00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:24.654
<v Peter Baksh>It'd be easier if I just show you and so
I don't try not to get.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/112-0
00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:20.534
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/114-1
00:15:24.654 --> 00:15:31.167
<v Peter Baksh>It's more my formatting too intimidated
by the sort of the screen.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/113-0
00:15:29.534 --> 00:15:29.734
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/114-2
00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:33.014
<v Peter Baksh>This is just an AI.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/116-0
00:15:33.574 --> 00:15:37.434
<v Peter Baksh>Window that I can type messages in here.
Now what?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/115-0
00:15:36.454 --> 00:15:36.654
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/116-1
00:15:37.434 --> 00:15:43.262
<v Peter Baksh>How this is different to standard one is
it can connect out to various other</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/116-2
00:15:43.262 --> 00:15:48.029
<v Peter Baksh>services so it can connect into my inbox.
It can connect into.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/116-3
00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:49.694
<v Peter Baksh>I use you were notion.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/117-0
00:15:50.894 --> 00:15:54.626
<v Simon Docherty>Uh, no. Last time we spoke,
you did demo it sort of looking at your</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/118-0
00:15:51.934 --> 00:15:58.384
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Now,
when you were talking about all the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/117-1
00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:55.614
<v Simon Docherty>emails and pieces.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/118-1
00:15:58.384 --> 00:16:00.534
<v Peter Baksh>things on monday.com.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/119-0
00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:07.222
<v Peter Baksh>Monday, dog.
I think you know you're talking about you.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/119-1
00:16:07.222 --> 00:16:14.180
<v Peter Baksh>Change stuff. Messages have to go out.
I think with your kind of oversight,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/119-2
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.934
<v Peter Baksh>a tool like this with connectivity would.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/120-0
00:16:18.294 --> 00:16:24.228
<v Peter Baksh>Rarely accelerate what you can do because
as well it can write local files.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/120-1
00:16:24.228 --> 00:16:30.239
<v Peter Baksh>So let's say you're going through,
you can just say sort of search the inbox</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/120-2
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:36.641
<v Peter Baksh>for a literary type search the inbox for
any cohorts with this name and give me a</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/120-3
00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:37.734
<v Peter Baksh>list of names.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/121-0
00:16:38.054 --> 00:16:41.132
<v Peter Baksh>Of the people who have declined as of
yesterday,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/121-1
00:16:41.132 --> 00:16:46.095
<v Peter Baksh>and it will do the filtering and the
search and then you can almost say, well,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/121-2
00:16:46.095 --> 00:16:49.676
<v Peter Baksh>now take that list,
have a look where their status is on</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/121-3
00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:54.889
<v Peter Baksh>monday.com and do some other processes.
So it's not that fully automated approach,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/121-4
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:55.894
<v Peter Baksh>but it's almost.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/123-0
00:16:56.454 --> 00:17:03.063
<v Peter Baksh>Collecting a lot of the bits and holding
on to them in its memory as it continued,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/122-0
00:16:58.614 --> 00:16:58.894
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/123-1
00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:09.433
<v Peter Baksh>and this is what so at the weekend what I
was just playing with was I'll try to</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/123-2
00:17:09.433 --> 00:17:13.494
<v Peter Baksh>find and it won't look too horrible.
Where was it?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/124-0
00:17:13.854 --> 00:17:18.894
<v Peter Baksh>An experiment. Why did that go go?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/125-0
00:17:16.254 --> 00:17:18.934
<v Simon Docherty>We do have a little issue on.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/126-0
00:17:21.894 --> 00:17:23.814
<v Simon Docherty>Outlook capturing.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/128-0
00:17:26.534 --> 00:17:30.391
<v Simon Docherty>All responses declines usually aren't too
bad. Well,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/128-1
00:17:30.391 --> 00:17:34.465
<v Simon Docherty>I say that usually there's an e-mail will
come through.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/128-2
00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:37.667
<v Simon Docherty>Some organisations don't turn on
responses,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/128-3
00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:42.614
<v Simon Docherty>so we don't always get to see if someone
is accepted or if they're.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/127-0
00:17:39.134 --> 00:17:39.494
<v Peter Baksh>OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/130-0
00:17:43.054 --> 00:17:46.106
<v Simon Docherty>Declined,
or if the tentative we tend to rely on a</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/129-0
00:17:45.094 --> 00:17:45.414
<v Peter Baksh>OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/130-1
00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:49.636
<v Simon Docherty>message coming through so IE you know you
can't attend it,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/130-2
00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:54.602
<v Simon Docherty>you'll generally speak up and say I can't
attend that session and then we can take</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/130-3
00:17:54.602 --> 00:17:57.294
<v Simon Docherty>those steps.
Hence we put that first bit in.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/132-0
00:17:58.374 --> 00:18:01.569
<v Simon Docherty>But now that you've now that you've
mentioned this,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/131-0
00:17:58.534 --> 00:17:58.854
<v Peter Baksh>Umm.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/132-1
00:18:01.569 --> 00:18:06.176
<v Simon Docherty>I've got another potential ID that would
save a little bit of time for us,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/132-2
00:18:06.176 --> 00:18:06.974
<v Simon Docherty>but carry on.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/133-0
00:18:07.054 --> 00:18:12.404
<v Peter Baksh>So this is I think a simplified
experiment I did of your suit of</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/133-1
00:18:12.404 --> 00:18:14.214
<v Peter Baksh>onboarding process so.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/135-0
00:18:16.894 --> 00:18:23.358
<v Peter Baksh>What it does to start with it,
there's I made a spreadsheet with cohorts</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/134-0
00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:20.854
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/135-1
00:18:23.358 --> 00:18:30.441
<v Peter Baksh>in and it's got 4 alternative dates for
those cohorts. So I just use two dates,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/135-2
00:18:30.441 --> 00:18:32.654
<v Peter Baksh>2 cohorts that have 4:00.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/137-0
00:18:33.214 --> 00:18:37.955
<v Peter Baksh>Potential dates and I've said there's a
maximum of five people that can go into</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/137-1
00:18:37.955 --> 00:18:41.155
<v Peter Baksh>each cohort.
I've got another spreadsheet of learners</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/137-2
00:18:41.155 --> 00:18:42.814
<v Peter Baksh>associated with each cohort.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/136-0
00:18:43.454 --> 00:18:43.574
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/138-0
00:18:44.254 --> 00:18:49.544
<v Peter Baksh>So what it first does is it would
effectively send out emails with the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/138-1
00:18:49.544 --> 00:18:54.461
<v Peter Baksh>invites to those learners,
and it would also automatically update</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/138-2
00:18:54.461 --> 00:18:59.974
<v Peter Baksh>the outcome component and we can do that
from this local thing. We can't.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/139-0
00:19:00.214 --> 00:19:06.681
<v Peter Baksh>At the moment from other methods,
so do that for all of the cohorts that I</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/139-1
00:19:06.681 --> 00:19:12.888
<v Peter Baksh>can see and then it simulates it,
waits a bit of time and then it has a</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/139-2
00:19:12.888 --> 00:19:16.854
<v Peter Baksh>look in your inbox.
So real time Inbox check.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/140-0
00:19:18.494 --> 00:19:23.569
<v Peter Baksh>And here it's picked up some emails
saying I've received my launch invite.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/140-1
00:19:23.569 --> 00:19:28.169
<v Peter Baksh>I have a work commitment.
Could please could I move to that one and</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/140-2
00:19:28.169 --> 00:19:30.334
<v Peter Baksh>we've got a few emails and then.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/141-0
00:19:31.654 --> 00:19:33.974
<v Peter Baksh>What we can see is it updates.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/142-0
00:19:35.334 --> 00:19:39.803
<v Peter Baksh>Those people who responded and it's
changed it from from date four.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/142-1
00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:44.534
<v Peter Baksh>So it's moved those dates and then
automatically sent the e-mail again.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/143-0
00:19:47.574 --> 00:19:48.294
<v Peter Baksh>And.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/144-0
00:19:50.374 --> 00:19:54.386
<v Peter Baksh>And as well updated app 10.
Now that's what I can't seem to be able</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/144-1
00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:58.574
<v Peter Baksh>to do within sort of the power automate.
The Microsoft suite of tools.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/146-0
00:20:01.294 --> 00:20:04.188
<v Peter Baksh>And that's sort of what got me thinking
about your workflow,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/146-1
00:20:04.188 --> 00:20:08.173
<v Peter Baksh>because this is not a full on automation.
It's the kind of thing that you'd have to</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/146-2
00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:10.451
<v Peter Baksh>speak.
You'd have to sort of type in the middle</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/145-0
00:20:09.774 --> 00:20:10.014
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/146-3
00:20:10.451 --> 00:20:13.392
<v Peter Baksh>of the day saying check,
run this check for me and it will go</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/146-4
00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:17.045
<v Peter Baksh>through the cohorts systematically.
It will look at the inbox systematically</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/146-5
00:20:17.045 --> 00:20:19.654
<v Peter Baksh>and then try to update things and send
off the emails.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/147-0
00:20:20.334 --> 00:20:20.534
<v Peter Baksh>I.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/148-0
00:20:24.734 --> 00:20:28.015
<v Peter Baksh>It's it's an interesting workflow in your
case,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/148-1
00:20:28.015 --> 00:20:33.689
<v Peter Baksh>because it's not give you an AI product
and you press go, it would be sort of you.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/148-2
00:20:33.689 --> 00:20:39.226
<v Peter Baksh>You would be given a very powerful tool
and I think you would probably need some</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/148-3
00:20:39.226 --> 00:20:40.934
<v Peter Baksh>assistance to start with.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/150-0
00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:47.372
<v Peter Baksh>But it is still sort of just taking that
tacit knowledge in your head,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/150-1
00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Peter Baksh>typing it in,
working out to what it where it works,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/149-0
00:20:47.734 --> 00:20:48.134
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/150-2
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.414
<v Peter Baksh>where it doesn't and.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/153-0
00:20:55.934 --> 00:21:02.494
<v Peter Baksh>I know there is interest in the business
for helping with onboarding so.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/152-0
00:21:00.094 --> 00:21:00.294
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/154-0
00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:08.587
<v Peter Baksh>To me, this feels like the type.
It may not look like that.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/154-1
00:21:08.587 --> 00:21:10.094
<v Peter Baksh>A tool that could help.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/155-0
00:21:12.294 --> 00:21:18.083
<v Peter Baksh>If I get the chance to get some time to
OK, I guess if my boss is effective,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/155-1
00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:21.842
<v Peter Baksh>say yes,
I'd like you to try to work on this with</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/155-2
00:21:21.842 --> 00:21:27.029
<v Peter Baksh>some employees like Simon.
Is that something you would be interested</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/155-3
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.254
<v Peter Baksh>in?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/156-0
00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:28.534
<v Simon Docherty>Definitely, yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/158-0
00:21:29.494 --> 00:21:31.837
<v Peter Baksh>OK.
Because I think there's a good</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/158-1
00:21:31.837 --> 00:21:35.651
<v Peter Baksh>intermediate step here.
I know the business ideally want</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/158-2
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:39.934
<v Peter Baksh>everything in Microsoft full automation
go, but yours is messy.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/157-0
00:21:36.694 --> 00:21:37.054
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/161-0
00:21:40.374 --> 00:21:43.749
<v Simon Docherty>Yes, it's very messy.
I think there's a point also where we've</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/161-1
00:21:43.749 --> 00:21:48.194
<v Simon Docherty>got to realise that not everything in the
world can be automated and that there is</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/161-2
00:21:48.194 --> 00:21:51.837
<v Simon Docherty>some interactions and oversight that's
that's needed because, yeah,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/160-0
00:21:48.374 --> 00:21:48.574
<v Peter Baksh>I know.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/161-3
00:21:51.837 --> 00:21:56.014
<v Simon Docherty>these are these are potentially emails.
But while we're working across those.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/162-0
00:21:56.334 --> 00:22:01.894
<v Simon Docherty>Three sort of systems. It is very clunky.
Um.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/163-0
00:22:01.494 --> 00:22:04.820
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.
And I also think just the feeling I get</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/163-1
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:10.531
<v Peter Baksh>from sort of conversations with James
Kelly is we don't want to turn into that</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/163-2
00:22:10.531 --> 00:22:15.303
<v Peter Baksh>organisation where it's very difficult to
get through to a human.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/163-3
00:22:15.303 --> 00:22:21.014
<v Peter Baksh>And so therefore this kind of let's just
have the human like you, who sort of.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/165-0
00:22:21.094 --> 00:22:25.346
<v Peter Baksh>Armed up to the teeth with tools to make
them more efficient,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/164-0
00:22:24.174 --> 00:22:24.414
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/165-1
00:22:25.346 --> 00:22:30.694
<v Peter Baksh>but ultimately if someone is rarely
finding it like none of these dates work,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/165-2
00:22:30.694 --> 00:22:34.192
<v Peter Baksh>then you can.
You can manage that rather than just</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/165-3
00:22:34.192 --> 00:22:36.454
<v Peter Baksh>coming back saying to be said no.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/166-0
00:22:34.814 --> 00:22:37.862
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
there's just talk in there.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/166-1
00:22:37.862 --> 00:22:42.094
<v Simon Docherty>There's some other tools. And again,
it would be sitting down with someone</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/166-2
00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:46.158
<v Simon Docherty>who's got a bit of knowledge,
like you said, not even automation tools.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/166-3
00:22:46.158 --> 00:22:48.528
<v Simon Docherty>Well,
semi automated tools whereby we can</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/166-4
00:22:48.528 --> 00:22:49.374
<v Simon Docherty>create invites.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/167-0
00:22:49.854 --> 00:22:53.398
<v Simon Docherty>All the information there is just getting
that knowledge out.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/167-1
00:22:53.398 --> 00:22:57.800
<v Simon Docherty>So there's one date for the invite.
We've got templates that we use that are</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/167-2
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.173
<v Simon Docherty>fairly bogged standard.
We've got the revised launch date.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/167-3
00:23:01.173 --> 00:23:04.317
<v Simon Docherty>So even just creating those, I mean,
what have we got?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/167-4
00:23:04.317 --> 00:23:06.374
<v Simon Docherty>7080 invites that we're sending out.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/169-0
00:23:07.414 --> 00:23:11.837
<v Simon Docherty>So even that would save a good amount of
time for people to just one click button.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/168-0
00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:08.054
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/169-1
00:23:11.837 --> 00:23:14.501
<v Simon Docherty>It gets that information and comes back
and goes.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/169-2
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:18.818
<v Simon Docherty>This is your invite and then we look and
just just that oversight piece but also</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/169-3
00:23:18.818 --> 00:23:22.494
<v Simon Docherty>pull in the names as well that would be
that'd be a fantastic start.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/170-0
00:23:22.974 --> 00:23:23.094
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/171-0
00:23:24.214 --> 00:23:25.454
<v Peter Baksh>OK, I think.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/173-0
00:23:27.254 --> 00:23:29.824
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah,
if if my boss is effectively say yeah,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/173-1
00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:34.336
<v Peter Baksh>onboarding is something we want to look
into my kind of answer would be it's a</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/173-2
00:23:34.336 --> 00:23:37.419
<v Peter Baksh>messy one.
It's the kind of thing that we would work.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/173-3
00:23:37.419 --> 00:23:41.759
<v Peter Baksh>I think it's going to be a mixture of
training and product rather than just</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/173-4
00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:45.014
<v Peter Baksh>develop something and ship it out.
I don't think you're.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/172-0
00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:42.374
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/175-0
00:23:45.614 --> 00:23:50.111
<v Peter Baksh>Error is suitable for that and it it
could be like you're saying sort of</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/175-1
00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:54.853
<v Peter Baksh>templates and stuff that could just be
some skills within Microsoft Word and</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/174-0
00:23:53.934 --> 00:23:54.214
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/175-2
00:23:54.853 --> 00:23:58.426
<v Peter Baksh>Microsoft Excel.
A bit of combination and create a little</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/175-3
00:23:58.426 --> 00:23:59.534
<v Peter Baksh>tool for yourself.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/177-0
00:24:02.134 --> 00:24:05.494
<v Peter Baksh>So yeah, that,
that's there's absolutely no guarantees.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/177-1
00:24:05.494 --> 00:24:08.254
<v Peter Baksh>I have no idea where the business want to
go,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/177-2
00:24:08.254 --> 00:24:11.374
<v Peter Baksh>but if that is something that would be
interesting,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/177-3
00:24:11.374 --> 00:24:16.234
<v Peter Baksh>I think it's a good sort of pilot case
actually of sort of training and tools as</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/176-0
00:24:15.374 --> 00:24:15.734
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/177-4
00:24:16.234 --> 00:24:19.654
<v Peter Baksh>opposed to generic training on one
extreme, which is OK,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/177-5
00:24:19.654 --> 00:24:21.454
<v Peter Baksh>but not usually that specific.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/179-0
00:24:21.854 --> 00:24:25.437
<v Peter Baksh>Or a complete tool that there's someone's
job on the other extreme,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/179-1
00:24:25.437 --> 00:24:28.915
<v Peter Baksh>this is it's that middle ground that
really needs to be attacked.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/179-2
00:24:28.915 --> 00:24:32.867
<v Peter Baksh>So if there is appetite for that,
I I would like to sort of push your your</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/178-0
00:24:32.574 --> 00:24:32.694
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/179-3
00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:34.974
<v Peter Baksh>case and your examples forward for that.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/180-0
00:24:34.414 --> 00:24:38.288
<v Simon Docherty>Definitely. I mean,
I've had conversations with Alan who</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/180-1
00:24:38.288 --> 00:24:41.414
<v Simon Docherty>started to look at this and the full
process.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/181-0
00:24:40.294 --> 00:24:42.014
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah. So I'm in Chile.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/182-0
00:24:42.734 --> 00:24:45.999
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah, yeah.
And then the last time I checked in with</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/182-1
00:24:45.999 --> 00:24:50.495
<v Simon Docherty>him, it sort of said, you know,
a bit like you in terms of there is that</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/182-2
00:24:50.495 --> 00:24:53.697
<v Simon Docherty>appetite. Yes, definitely.
We want to look at this.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/182-3
00:24:53.697 --> 00:24:57.454
<v Simon Docherty>We understand that it's a, you know,
it's a very convoluted.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/183-0
00:24:57.774 --> 00:25:01.300
<v Simon Docherty>System that we're running and I'm going
to check back in is like, no,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/183-1
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.926
<v Simon Docherty>we've got no confirmed dates on as to
whether we are running with this.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/183-2
00:25:04.926 --> 00:25:08.350
<v Simon Docherty>So I'm stuck in that limbo,
sort of because I've got quite a lot of</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/183-3
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.127
<v Simon Docherty>people that's talking to me saying, well,
we can look at this and we could</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/183-4
00:25:12.127 --> 00:25:13.134
<v Simon Docherty>potentially do this.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/184-0
00:25:13.534 --> 00:25:16.483
<v Simon Docherty>But there's actually nobody's come back
and said yes,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/184-1
00:25:16.483 --> 00:25:20.741
<v Simon Docherty>we're going to sit down and we're going
to focus on how we do that. But even,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/184-2
00:25:20.741 --> 00:25:23.635
<v Simon Docherty>you know,
just that one tool that isn't necessarily,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/184-3
00:25:23.635 --> 00:25:27.948
<v Simon Docherty>I say it's not necessarily that complex
to create thinking about these are all</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/184-4
00:25:27.948 --> 00:25:29.094
<v Simon Docherty>fixed points in time.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/185-0
00:25:29.774 --> 00:25:32.153
<v Simon Docherty>Sort of thing. It's all fixed data,
isn't it?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/185-1
00:25:32.153 --> 00:25:34.893
<v Simon Docherty>We know that the learners that are going
on the CLM,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/185-2
00:25:34.893 --> 00:25:38.978
<v Simon Docherty>we know when the data of the launches,
we know the time of the launch and just</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/185-3
00:25:38.978 --> 00:25:43.217
<v Simon Docherty>pulling that in to just create that one
tool that will save a lot of time and cut</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/185-4
00:25:43.217 --> 00:25:45.854
<v Simon Docherty>down on any errors that might come around
as well.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/186-0
00:25:46.414 --> 00:25:49.374
<v Simon Docherty>You know,
so that would definitely help us.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/189-0
00:25:48.334 --> 00:25:52.250
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah, I mean, I mean,
I'd love the opportunity just to sort of</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/189-1
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:57.471
<v Peter Baksh>sit down with you maybe for like 3-4 days
for like 2 hours a day or something where</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/189-2
00:25:57.471 --> 00:26:02.256
<v Peter Baksh>you we rarely get into a problem and I
spend the rest of the days working on</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/189-3
00:26:02.256 --> 00:26:07.229
<v Peter Baksh>this is how you're going to do it between
Word, Excel and ChatGPT or something.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/187-0
00:26:05.134 --> 00:26:05.414
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/188-0
00:26:06.894 --> 00:26:07.014
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/189-4
00:26:07.229 --> 00:26:07.974
<v Peter Baksh>And then we.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/192-0
00:26:08.094 --> 00:26:11.200
<v Peter Baksh>We keep going, but it's I have an idea.
Like a feeling.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/192-1
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.582
<v Peter Baksh>I do need to sort of sit down and we
would say like this is where they sit and</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/190-0
00:26:13.854 --> 00:26:13.974
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/192-2
00:26:15.582 --> 00:26:18.799
<v Peter Baksh>stuff like that.
And I think there's so many areas of the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/191-0
00:26:16.734 --> 00:26:17.014
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/192-3
00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:23.014
<v Peter Baksh>business where this can benefit and
people just don't have the time to sort</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/192-4
00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:27.451
<v Peter Baksh>of like there's no expectation on you
that you go out and get brilliant at male</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/192-5
00:26:27.451 --> 00:26:27.894
<v Peter Baksh>mergers.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/193-0
00:26:27.974 --> 00:26:31.843
<v Peter Baksh>Is Excel power query.
I'm curious that power query set up.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/193-1
00:26:31.843 --> 00:26:35.385
<v Peter Baksh>Did you design that yourself or did
someone else? OK,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/195-0
00:26:34.534 --> 00:26:38.864
<v Simon Docherty>Yes. No, I did that. I yes,
I've done ADA 4 programme.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/193-2
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:37.614
<v Peter Baksh>so you'll have to get power query.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/195-1
00:26:38.864 --> 00:26:42.407
<v Simon Docherty>I did that a couple of years.
We called out.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/195-2
00:26:42.407 --> 00:26:47.288
<v Simon Docherty>So that was that was my one sort of
takeaway was power query.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/194-0
00:26:43.094 --> 00:26:44.694
<v Peter Baksh>I will, OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/195-3
00:26:47.288 --> 00:26:53.665
<v Simon Docherty>But again it's using it and and and sort
of I did the more you use it the better</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/195-4
00:26:53.665 --> 00:26:54.294
<v Simon Docherty>you get.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/198-0
00:26:54.614 --> 00:26:57.232
<v Simon Docherty>Isn't it?
And I think the purpose of like a power</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/196-0
00:26:55.494 --> 00:26:55.734
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/198-1
00:26:57.232 --> 00:27:00.007
<v Simon Docherty>query is that you set it once and it does
its thing,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/198-2
00:27:00.007 --> 00:27:02.677
<v Simon Docherty>so you're not creating new spreadsheets
every day,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/198-3
00:27:02.677 --> 00:27:05.243
<v Simon Docherty>or you're not working on new problems
every day.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/198-4
00:27:05.243 --> 00:27:09.275
<v Simon Docherty>So it's getting into that area of the
business whereby that constantly comes</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/198-5
00:27:09.275 --> 00:27:11.892
<v Simon Docherty>around,
that you get comfortable with every query</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/198-6
00:27:11.892 --> 00:27:13.934
<v Simon Docherty>and new queries and getting head round.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/199-0
00:27:14.334 --> 00:27:15.574
<v Simon Docherty>Lots of problems and things.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/197-0
00:27:14.414 --> 00:27:14.534
<v Peter Baksh>Good.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/203-0
00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:20.439
<v Peter Baksh>I mean, it's interesting,
just an awareness of DA 4 because</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/200-0
00:27:17.934 --> 00:27:18.054
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/203-1
00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:24.995
<v Peter Baksh>obviously you did a little bit of Python
in that, I think yeah, well,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/201-0
00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:24.054
<v Simon Docherty>Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/203-2
00:27:24.995 --> 00:27:30.137
<v Peter Baksh>just because power query is quite rigid.
I find like it doesn't deal with Edge</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/203-3
00:27:30.137 --> 00:27:32.414
<v Peter Baksh>faces very well. It has to be very.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/202-0
00:27:31.574 --> 00:27:31.694
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/204-0
00:27:33.854 --> 00:27:36.893
<v Peter Baksh>But with like the tool I showed you on my
slide code,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/204-1
00:27:36.893 --> 00:27:40.889
<v Peter Baksh>it can very quickly write itself Python
scripts to solve your problem.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/204-2
00:27:40.889 --> 00:27:44.941
<v Peter Baksh>So if you just describe that power query
so that you've already set up,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/204-3
00:27:44.941 --> 00:27:49.217
<v Peter Baksh>it would actually write to your Python
script and then you can just execute</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/204-4
00:27:49.217 --> 00:27:52.650
<v Peter Baksh>whenever you wanted.
Now that suddenly becomes very flexible</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/204-5
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.494
<v Peter Baksh>because Python.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/207-0
00:27:53.574 --> 00:27:58.840
<v Peter Baksh>You can do so much on your local files
and now we don't have to be brilliant at</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/207-1
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.723
<v Peter Baksh>Python to be able to write it.
We just have to know. Yeah,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/205-0
00:28:00.334 --> 00:28:00.614
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/207-2
00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:07.331
<v Peter Baksh>it looks about right. So yeah,
I'm just repeating myself effectively.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/207-3
00:28:07.331 --> 00:28:11.082
<v Peter Baksh>I think there's lots of opportunity if I
get the chance.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/207-4
00:28:11.082 --> 00:28:13.254
<v Peter Baksh>I'd love to try to work with you.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/209-0
00:28:13.334 --> 00:28:17.419
<v Peter Baksh>You and if you have the time,
but I'll keep you updated and do reach</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/206-0
00:28:13.934 --> 00:28:14.054
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/208-0
00:28:17.214 --> 00:28:18.014
<v Simon Docherty>No, definitely.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/209-1
00:28:17.419 --> 00:28:21.978
<v Peter Baksh>out if you have any questions that I
could immediately help with then I will</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/209-2
00:28:21.978 --> 00:28:22.214
<v Peter Baksh>try.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/211-0
00:28:23.014 --> 00:28:26.174
<v Simon Docherty>Fantastic. No, that's quite exciting.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/210-0
00:28:24.574 --> 00:28:24.694
<v Peter Baksh>None.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/213-0
00:28:27.614 --> 00:28:31.511
<v Peter Baksh>I I can't promise anything. I, as I said,
I don't have the direction,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/212-0
00:28:29.094 --> 00:28:29.334
<v Simon Docherty>No.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/213-1
00:28:31.511 --> 00:28:35.574
<v Peter Baksh>but I I think you you've got a very nice
cheesecake. So fingers crossed.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/214-0
00:28:35.974 --> 00:28:38.564
<v Simon Docherty>Well, hopefully, hopefully,
if we like you said,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/214-1
00:28:38.564 --> 00:28:40.254
<v Simon Docherty>go and talk to the right people.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/215-0
00:28:41.654 --> 00:28:45.357
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah, yeah.
I think there's ROI and they always like</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/215-1
00:28:45.357 --> 00:28:50.387
<v Peter Baksh>to hit me with ROI. What's the return?
I think there's a lot of return,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/215-2
00:28:50.387 --> 00:28:51.574
<v Peter Baksh>but anyway go on.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/217-0
00:28:51.374 --> 00:28:55.286
<v Simon Docherty>Definitely. I mean,
we're talking about again just to add to</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/217-1
00:28:55.286 --> 00:28:59.840
<v Simon Docherty>your ROI on there is we're talking about
expanding our department out.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/216-0
00:28:56.214 --> 00:28:56.414
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/217-2
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.662
<v Simon Docherty>So part of our job role is to support
Pdes,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/217-3
00:29:02.662 --> 00:29:06.894
<v Simon Docherty>coaches with facilitation or improving
their facilitation skills.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/219-0
00:29:07.574 --> 00:29:12.190
<v Simon Docherty>As well as supporting in sickness,
so the more time we can free up from what</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/219-1
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.486
<v Simon Docherty>we're doing,
we can step in and then support where the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/219-2
00:29:15.486 --> 00:29:20.281
<v Simon Docherty>sickness and jump in on last minute one
to ones or reviews or things like that.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/218-0
00:29:18.094 --> 00:29:18.214
<v Peter Baksh>Oh.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/219-3
00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:24.956
<v Simon Docherty>But we need that time to then be able to
develop ourselves or work with other</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/219-4
00:29:24.956 --> 00:29:26.574
<v Simon Docherty>coaches to support them so.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/220-0
00:29:27.054 --> 00:29:30.915
<v Simon Docherty>Comfortable in facilitation,
which in itself the more coaches we get</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/220-1
00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:34.552
<v Simon Docherty>to facilitate a launch,
then the less we have to step in and the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/220-2
00:29:34.552 --> 00:29:37.798
<v Simon Docherty>more we can then do for backup stuff or
the backup tasks,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/220-3
00:29:37.798 --> 00:29:41.994
<v Simon Docherty>there's a lot of editing and pieces and
things that we have to do with the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/220-4
00:29:41.994 --> 00:29:46.247
<v Simon Docherty>uploads for app time afterwards and that
takes a little bit of time as well</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/220-5
00:29:46.247 --> 00:29:46.694
<v Simon Docherty>because.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/224-0
00:29:46.774 --> 00:29:50.035
<v Simon Docherty>We're now recording the launches,
but we have breakout rooms.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/221-0
00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:49.254
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/224-1
00:29:50.035 --> 00:29:53.190
<v Simon Docherty>So your two choices,
you either run the session all the way</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/222-0
00:29:50.494 --> 00:29:50.734
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/224-2
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.714
<v Simon Docherty>through or you stop them at the breakout
rooms.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/223-0
00:29:54.454 --> 00:29:54.614
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/224-3
00:29:55.714 --> 00:29:59.869
<v Simon Docherty>But currently we try and get people to
stop at the breakout rooms because they</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/224-4
00:29:59.869 --> 00:30:01.814
<v Simon Docherty>have conversations in the background.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/225-0
00:30:02.254 --> 00:30:07.157
<v Simon Docherty>So while the learners are aware they will
have conversations and you're like, well,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/225-1
00:30:07.157 --> 00:30:11.943
<v Simon Docherty>I can't leave that and can I, you know,
so we have to do a quite a bit of editing</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/225-2
00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:16.379
<v Simon Docherty>and then as the launches increase,
we'll be doing more and more on the day,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/225-3
00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:19.414
<v Simon Docherty>which is obviously even more time
consuming for us.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/226-0
00:30:20.254 --> 00:30:24.341
<v Simon Docherty>I mean our peak just again when you talk
about that our peak coming up,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/226-1
00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:27.974
<v Simon Docherty>I've just looked in November,
we've got 17 launches on one day.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/228-0
00:30:29.614 --> 00:30:36.238
<v Simon Docherty>Which is a lot to manage in one day.
Even the background stuff of finishing</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/227-0
00:30:32.614 --> 00:30:32.974
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/228-1
00:30:36.238 --> 00:30:40.334
<v Simon Docherty>and sorting the workshop, stuff like that.
So.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/229-0
00:30:40.934 --> 00:30:44.037
<v Peter Baksh>I mean just that that case you're talking
about.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/229-1
00:30:44.037 --> 00:30:49.166
<v Peter Baksh>So where you're encouraging coaches to
sort of split their recordings during the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/229-2
00:30:49.166 --> 00:30:52.648
<v Peter Baksh>break hour and that is another just with
the AI tools,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/229-3
00:30:52.648 --> 00:30:55.814
<v Peter Baksh>it's effectively just have a look at this
folder.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/230-0
00:30:56.494 --> 00:31:00.940
<v Peter Baksh>They will all have the same ID,
so you just tell Claude they all have the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/230-1
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.763
<v Peter Baksh>same ID.
Take the MP fours and then take these</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/230-2
00:31:03.763 --> 00:31:08.449
<v Peter Baksh>five MP fours. Stitch them together,
create a new one and I know you probably</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/230-3
00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:12.714
<v Peter Baksh>have editing tools to do it,
but it's a lot quicker just being able to</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/230-4
00:31:12.714 --> 00:31:13.254
<v Peter Baksh>say just.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/233-0
00:31:13.854 --> 00:31:17.150
<v Peter Baksh>Do it and that's just again.
I keep going back.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/231-0
00:31:13.894 --> 00:31:15.254
<v Simon Docherty>Definitely would be, yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/233-1
00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:22.641
<v Peter Baksh>You've got lots of messy use cases and
just being able to be tall enabled would</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/233-2
00:31:22.641 --> 00:31:24.014
<v Peter Baksh>be, I think, a huge.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/235-0
00:31:24.694 --> 00:31:27.172
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah, yeah,
because because there's so many different</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/234-0
00:31:25.694 --> 00:31:26.454
<v Peter Baksh>Huge win.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/235-1
00:31:27.172 --> 00:31:29.190
<v Simon Docherty>variables in there that actually,
you know,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/235-2
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Simon Docherty>it's one of those when people start
talking and you say, yeah,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/235-3
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.384
<v Simon Docherty>this is this is how it works in theory.
But then there's this occasion.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/235-4
00:31:35.384 --> 00:31:38.090
<v Simon Docherty>And then there's that occasion.
And then there's this one.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/235-5
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.155
<v Simon Docherty>And then there's that one.
And you're right.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/235-6
00:31:40.155 --> 00:31:42.494
<v Simon Docherty>It doesn't always run as smooth as you
would hope.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/236-0
00:31:43.174 --> 00:31:44.014
<v Simon Docherty>And as you would like.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/237-0
00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:49.599
<v Peter Baksh>And I know you brought up,
it's again your role being the RO.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/237-1
00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:54.879
<v Peter Baksh>You mentioned about the ROI by the sounds
of it as we're scaling and you are being</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/237-2
00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:58.887
<v Peter Baksh>given more stuff to do.
One of the challenges I'm finding is I</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/237-3
00:31:58.887 --> 00:32:03.149
<v Peter Baksh>could say to seniors, oh,
I could make PDA's got 5% more efficient</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/237-4
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:04.294
<v Peter Baksh>and it's like the.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/240-0
00:32:04.814 --> 00:32:09.241
<v Peter Baksh>What are they going to do with that time?
We haven't got a good mechanism as the</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/240-1
00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:13.339
<v Peter Baksh>business sees it to get the money back.
But your role by the sounds of it,</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/240-2
00:32:13.339 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Peter Baksh>they've already kind of got stuff that
you should be doing if the time was there.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/238-0
00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:16.694
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/240-3
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.880
<v Peter Baksh>So therefore the ROI is immediately
released, which is.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/239-0
00:32:20.734 --> 00:32:21.054
<v Simon Docherty>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/240-4
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.574
<v Peter Baksh>So I'm glad you mentioned that.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/241-0
00:32:23.254 --> 00:32:23.374
<v Peter Baksh>None.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/243-0
00:32:24.854 --> 00:32:28.939
<v Peter Baksh>Brilliant. Yeah. Thank you for,
for calling me back so quick.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/243-1
00:32:28.939 --> 00:32:33.419

And I will I press your case.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/242-0
00:32:29.494 --> 00:32:30.094
<v Simon Docherty>No problem.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/243-2
00:32:33.419 --> 00:32:37.043
<v Peter Baksh>And if if it does come up, I'll.
I'll get back to you.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/243-3
00:32:37.043 --> 00:32:42.181
<v Peter Baksh>And if you have any like questions that
you think I could AI just immediately</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/243-4
00:32:42.181 --> 00:32:43.894
<v Peter Baksh>help here then please ask.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/245-0
00:32:44.534 --> 00:32:48.532
<v Simon Docherty>Definitely I will do. It's I'm.
I'm starting to think a bit more.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/244-0
00:32:46.734 --> 00:32:47.854
<v Peter Baksh>Cool. OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/245-1
00:32:48.532 --> 00:32:53.134
<v Simon Docherty>I'm starting with after that demo you
gave was was like all right. OK yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/246-0
00:32:54.134 --> 00:32:57.134
<v Peter Baksh>Do you what AI tools do you currently use?</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/249-0
00:32:57.374 --> 00:33:03.694
<v Simon Docherty>I use copilot and and I've got whatever I
got on my phone perplexity.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/247-0
00:32:59.534 --> 00:32:59.854
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/250-0
00:33:04.654 --> 00:33:05.014
<v Peter Baksh>OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/253-0
00:33:06.054 --> 00:33:10.842
<v Simon Docherty>Only because it came free as part of O2.
So I've got a year's subscription with it</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/251-0
00:33:09.694 --> 00:33:09.974
<v Peter Baksh>OK.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/253-1
00:33:10.842 --> 00:33:15.167
<v Simon Docherty>and I'll be honest at the minute,
this is what I was saying the last time.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/253-2
00:33:15.167 --> 00:33:19.724
<v Simon Docherty>It's not that I can't make use of it.
I just don't see a general use for it in</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/253-3
00:33:19.724 --> 00:33:21.454
<v Simon Docherty>what I'm doing and where I am.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/254-0
00:33:22.014 --> 00:33:25.002
<v Simon Docherty>And you know,
I'm not being that or fair with it.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/252-0
00:33:22.294 --> 00:33:22.534
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/254-1
00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:29.303
<v Simon Docherty>Therefore, I can't in my head.
I could say yes if we can ultimate doing</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/254-2
00:33:29.303 --> 00:33:33.426
<v Simon Docherty>this and we can get this done,
but I couldn't even start to to think</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/254-3
00:33:33.426 --> 00:33:36.174
<v Simon Docherty>about how to to sort of create that you
know.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/256-0
00:33:34.974 --> 00:33:37.731
<v Peter Baksh>Yeah,
this is where we have two hours just</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/256-1
00:33:37.731 --> 00:33:41.706
<v Peter Baksh>sitting down here and then just you know,
it will charge you.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/256-2
00:33:41.706 --> 00:33:46.258
<v Peter Baksh>The enterprise could create this
spreadsheet for you and connect it to</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/256-3
00:33:46.258 --> 00:33:48.694
<v Peter Baksh>this Word document be really valuable.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/257-0
00:33:49.214 --> 00:33:49.454
<v Peter Baksh>Umm.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/255-0
00:33:49.654 --> 00:33:50.334
<v Simon Docherty>Definitely.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/258-0
00:33:51.614 --> 00:33:57.426
<v Peter Baksh>OK, I'll have a thing and yeah,
hopefully we can make some progress.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/258-1
00:33:57.426 --> 00:34:00.374
<v Peter Baksh>But yeah. Yeah. Thanks for sharing.</v>

48ab642b-cd6f-4fc9-a8c8-8902eade8fdf/259-0
00:33:59.454 --> 00:34:03.534
<v Simon Docherty>Excellent. No, thank you.
That's like I say, quite exciting.</v>
